					IMPACT OF GLOBAL WARMING
                    <h3>Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020
                         was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase
                          heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move
                           around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when 
                           conditions are hotter.Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall.
                            This results in more severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding 
                           and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of dollars.
                           Climate change can be a natural process where temperature, rainfall, wind and other
                            elements vary over decades or more. In millions of years, our world has been warmer
                             and colder than it is now. But today we are experiencing unprecedented rapid warming
                              from human activities, primarily due to burning fossil fuels that generate greenhouse 
                              gas emissions.

           How We Can Tackle Global Warming By Changing 10 Simple Thing In Our Daily Routine 
				</h1>
                <h2>Change a light
                    Replacing one regular light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb will save 150 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. 
                    
                    Drive less 
                    Walk, bike, carpool or take mass transit more often. You'll save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile you don't drive!
                    
                    Recycle more
                    You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.
                    
                     when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
                     1. Speak up! · 2. Power your home with renewable energy. · 3. Weatherize, weatherize, weatherize. · 4. Invest in energy-efficient appliances.
